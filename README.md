Creating Wordle in multiple languages. The plan is to do Python (done), Java (in-progress), and JavaScript (not started). The Python and Java versions will be text-based, but JavaScript will be an opportunity to mimic the visual aspects. Future additions might include the hard mode and sharing options.

The current dictionary is based on words I manually added.

1/25 - Python version is basic, but functional.

1/26 - setup Java for VS use.
